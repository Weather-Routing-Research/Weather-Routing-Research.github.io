This month of June, the [Foundations of Computational Mathematics (FoCM) Conference in Paris](https://www.focm2023.org/) hosted a talk by Rodrigo Takuro Sato Martín de Almagro, one of our team's researchers. He showcased his latest findings on geometric integration and computational mechanics.

His presentation was titled "Parallel Iterative Methods for Variational Integration and Related Problems". Rodrigo introduced a parallelization approach for solving discrete variational equations. This method maximizes the capabilities of multicore CPUs and GPUs, improving computational results.

We also want to highlight Rodrigo's thorough examination of higher-order Lagrangian systems and his detailed study on the discrete Jacobi equation. The presentation part of a collaboration with Sebastián J. Ferraro from the Universidad Nacional del Sur & CONICET and David Martín de Diego from the Instituto de Ciencias Matemáticas. This research was partly supported by the BBVA Foundation.

Rodrigo's participation in the FoCM conference showcases our team's dedication to advance the field of computational mathematics. We are proud of Rodrigo's commitment and contributions, and we look forward to more pioneering research and presentations from him and our team in the future.
