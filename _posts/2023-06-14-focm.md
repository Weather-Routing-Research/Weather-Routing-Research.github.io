This June at the [Foundations of Computational Mathematics (FoCM) Conference in Paris](https://www.focm2023.org/), Rodrigo Takuro Sato Martín de Almagro, one of our researchers, presented his latest insights on geometric integration and computational mechanics.

Titled "Parallel Iterative Methods for Variational Integration and Related Problems", Rodrigo's talk dived into the complexities of discrete variational methods. His exploration centered on a parallelization strategy for the solution of discrete variational equations, effectively leveraging the power of multicore CPUs and GPUs for enhanced computational outcomes.

Rodrigo's dedication to studying higher-order Lagrangian systems and his comprehensive research into the discrete Jacobi equation were especially commendable. The talk was the result of a collaborative effort with Sebastián J. Ferraro from the Universidad Nacional del Sur & CONICET and David Martín de Diego from the Instituto de Ciencias Matemáticas. This collaboration was partly possible thanks to the funding from the BBVA Foundation.

It's moments like these that further solidify our team's commitment to advancing the realm of computational mathematics. Rodrigo's presence and contribution to the FoCM conference showcases our active role in shaping the future of the field. Kudos to Rodrigo for his stellar representation and dedication! We eagerly anticipate more groundbreaking research and talks in the future.
