The scientific workshop ["Environmental Monitoring: An Exploratory Workshop"](https://wimoboproject.com/index.php/event/) recently took place at the prestigious [Royal Spanish Academy of Sciences (RAC)](https://rac.es/). The event brought together experts in environmental science and maritime transportation to tackle ecological challenges faced by the blue economy and find innovative weather routing solutions.

The workshop kicked off with a keynote by [David Gómez-Ullate](https://www.ie.edu/university/about/faculty/david-gomez-ullate/), professor at IE university and lead researcher of our weather routing project. He gave a plenary talk introducing the problem of weather routing, the required data, models and optimization methods and giving a broad perspective on the history and economic implications of this technology.

Next was [Daniel Precioso](https://daniprec.github.io), who presented his Hybrid Search algorithm as part of the research on his PhD. This approach addresses the Zermelo's Navigation Problem by combining optimal path search methods with variational refinement. Through real-world examples, Daniel showcased how the application of mathematics significantly enhances navigation capabilities, fostering the ecological transition in maritime transportation.

Following Daniel's presentation, [Rafael Ballester-Ripoll](https://www.ie.edu/university/about/faculty/rafael-ballester-ripoll/), professor at IE University, introduced an alternative solution for weather routing, drawing inspiration from evolutionary algorithms and the Bézier curves. His research showcased the potential for diverse approaches to drive sustainable advancements in the blue economy.

The session also included talks from [Fernando Cañavate](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fernando-ca%C3%B1avate-vega-17b253a) and [José Enrique Gutiérrez](https://personas.upct.es/perfil/jose.gutierrez), two naval engineers working on different aspects of this project.

Generous financial support from the [BBVA Foundation](https://www.fbbva.es/) played a crucial role in the workshop's success, demonstrating their commitment to environmental research and sustainability.
