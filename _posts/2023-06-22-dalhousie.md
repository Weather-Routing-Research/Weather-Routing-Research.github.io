Our research in weather routing has opened doors to fruitful collaborations, with one of the most significant ones being with Dalhousie University, represented by the esteemed Professor Robert Milson from the Department of Mathematics. It was an enriching experience to host Professor Milson during his brief stay in Madrid, where we gathered at the IE Tower to conduct in-depth research on weather routing, culminating in the completion of our first joint paper titled "Hybrid Search Method for Zermelo's Navigation Problem," which is currently under revision.

The collaboration with Dalhousie University also presents exciting internship opportunities. Over the next few months, we will be joined by Louis Bu, a mathematics graduate from Dalhousie. Louis will work with us at the Tower as we continue to advance our optimization algorithms, aiming to present our findings at prestigious conferences and explore the possibility of a second publication.

As we progress, we remain committed to refining our methods and furthering our understanding of weather routing, with the ultimate goal of creating more efficient and sustainable navigation solutions. The insights gained from this collaboration are invaluable, and we eagerly anticipate future projects that will undoubtedly pave the way for innovative advancements in the domain of maritime transportation and ecological conservation.

With heartfelt appreciation to the BBVA Foundation, IE University and our esteemed partners at Dalhousie University, we strive to continue pushing the boundaries of weather routing research and contributing to the global effort for a greener and more sustainable future. Together, we believe our collective endeavors will make a significant impact on the world's maritime industry.
