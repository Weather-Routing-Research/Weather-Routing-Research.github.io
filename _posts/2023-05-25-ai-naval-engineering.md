At the [62nd International Congress of Naval Engineering and Maritime Industry](https://www.group.sener/evento/62-congreso-internacional-ingenieria-naval/), our team's groundbreaking research on optimizing the sea behavior of fishing ships through artificial neural networks was awarded the first prize. We are incredibly proud of our fellow researchers, José Enrique Gutiérrez, Pablo Romero, Antonio José Lorente from the School of Naval and Oceanic Engineering at UPCT, and Borja Serván Camas from the Centre Internacional de Mètodes Numèrics en Enginyeria.

Titled "Optimization of seakeeping behavior of fishing ships by artificial neural networks", the study harnesses the power of artificial intelligence to significantly reduce computation time in predicting ship behavior under various environmental conditions, such as during a storm. José Enrique Gutiérrez highlighted that while traditional numerical calculation methods could take days for a single prediction, the team's algorithms can evaluate millions of alternatives within the same time frame – a leap in efficiency.

This AI-centric approach allows for a detailed analysis of ship behavior at sea, which is crucial for vessel operation. The research team's further efforts are focused on finding optimal ship designs to enhance both performance and safety based on specific operational metrics.
