Daniel Precioso from our research group went to Halifax, Canada. The main goal was to work on improving our weather routing algorithms.

He teamed up with Dalhousie University for this project. With the help of Dr. Robert Milson, a Mathematics professor at the university, and Louis Bu, a graduate student, we are working on better weather routing solutions. This partnership follows our goal to make shipping better and more sustainable.

Daniel also visited The PIER (Port Innovation, Engagement and Research) in Halifax. This place is known for its work on transportation, supply chains, and ports. Daniel met David Thomas, who leads The PIER. During his visit, our team talked about our research and began discussions with other experts at The PIER. We are excited about the connections we made and hope to work together on future projects.

This trip was an important step for us, and we're eager to share more updates soon!
