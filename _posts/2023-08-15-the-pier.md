Our current research, backed by the BBVA Foundation and IE University, focuses on the intricate world of weather routing algorithms. Developing reliable optimization algorithms for shipping routes require both academic research and practical maritime expertise. This August, our post-doc researcher Daniel Precioso, had the chance to experience both aspects of weather routing.

Daniel's trip was a continuation of our collaboration with Dalhousie University. Dr. Robert Milson of the Mathematics Department welcomed Daniel, and together with Louis Bu, a graduate student in mathematics, they expanded our research on the optimization algorithms. Fruit of this collaboration, our algorithms are now able to run on more complex scenarios, thanks to the implementation of better cost functions and sailing restrictions.

The journey wasn't just about mathematics. Daniel and Louis visited The PIER in Halifax, invited by The PIER director, David Thomas. The PIER is well-known for connecting state-of-the-art academic research with the maritime industry. Engaging with maritime professionals there led to fresh perspectives, promising more in-depth insights and potential tools for our project in the future.
