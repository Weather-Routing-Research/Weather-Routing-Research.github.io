This week, Daniel Precioso from the Weather Navigation team visited Dubai to present our weather routing project at [Prototypes for Humanity 2024](https://www.prototypesforhumanity.com/). This prestigious event showcases the innovative solutions with the power to achieve a better future. The Prototypes for Humanity programme supports high-potential technological innovations emerging from the academic world.

Over 2000 solutions were submitted to Prototypes for Humanity 2024, and only 100 of them were chosen. Being selected to present in Dubai is a major milestone for Weather Navigation. The event took place at the Dubai Emirates Towers, where Daniel presented our project to a large audience of professionals and researchers from around the world. This exposure has opened up exciting opportunities for collaboration and further advancements in our project.

Our Weather Navigation team is developing state-of-the-art algorithms for weather routing in maritime transport. We optimize maritime routes by taking into account real-time oceanographic and meteorological data, achieving savings of around 3-7% without incurring any retrofitting costs. Weather Navigation will help reduce fuel consumption, emissions, and costs, while also improving safety and efficiency in maritime transport.

This research is supported by:

- [BBVA Foundation](https://www.fbbva.es/) via the project "Mathematical optimization for a more efficient, safer and decarbonized maritime transport".

- Spanish [Agencia Estatal de Investigaci√≥n](https://www.aei.gob.es/) under grant  TED2021-129455B-I00, "Optimization of maritime routes with real time oceanographic and meteorological data".
