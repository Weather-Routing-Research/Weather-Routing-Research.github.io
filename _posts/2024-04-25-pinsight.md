Our research team travelled to Halifax (Canada) to participate in **PINsight 2024**, an innovation forum organised by [**The PIER**](https://thepierhfx.com/) under the umbrella of the **Port Innovators Network (PIN)**. The event convened representatives from leading ports, accelerators, and technology providers to exchange best practices in digital decarbonisation.

During the technical session, we presented our weather routing solution: a decision‑support platform that fuses high‑resolution meteorological and oceanographic forecasts with multi‑objective optimisation to reduce voyage emissions, fuel consumption, and operational risk.

This visit marks our **second collaboration stint at The PIER**, reinforcing a partnership aimed at translating academic research into operational value for the global port community.
