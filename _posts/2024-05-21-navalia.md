Last week, a multidisciplinary team from IE University travelled to Vigo to showcase our weather routing solution at [Navalia 2024](https://www.navalia.es/), Spain's flagship exhibition for shipbuilding and maritime engineering.  

Alongside naval architects, shipowners and technology providers, our students delivered a live demonstration of the platform's decision‑support capabilities, highlighting how near‑real‑time environmental data and multi‑objective optimisation can lower fuel consumption and emissions.

Navalia's vibrant professional audience provided invaluable technical feedback and opened new avenues for pilot deployments. For the students, the event marked an exceptional opportunity to translate classroom research into an industrial context and to engage directly with the stakeholders driving maritime decarbonisation.

This research is supported by:

- [BBVA Foundation](https://www.fbbva.es/) via the project "Mathematical optimization for a more efficient, safer and decarbonized maritime transport".

- Spanish [Agencia Estatal de Investigación](https://www.aei.gob.es/) under grant  TED2021-129455B-I00, "Optimization of maritime routes with real time oceanographic and meteorological data".
