This month, Daniel Precioso from the Weather Navigation team was featured on an episode of [*The Conversation Weekly*](https://theconversation.com/a-google-maps-for-the-sea-sails-and-alternative-fuels-the-technologies-steering-shipping-towards-lower-emissions-podcast-253088), a global podcast that brings together expert voices on some of today's most pressing global challenges.

In this episode, Daniel presented our research on maritime routing algorithms. We leverage real-time environmental data (such as wind, wave, and ocean current forecasts) to support lower-emission, safer, and more efficient shipping. These optimization techniques are designed to reduce fuel consumption and travel time, offering practical tools for the transition toward a more sustainable maritime sector.

He was joined by Professor Alice Larkin from the University of Manchester, who contributed a broader view on decarbonizing the shipping industry, from sail-assisted propulsion to the future of alternative fuels.

Daniel's participation in the podcast follows his involvement in an interdisciplinary research initiative between **IE University** and **Universidad de Cádiz**, focused on the **optimization of maritime routes** for safer, more efficient, and more sustainable transport. This ongoing project aims to develop high-precision routing algorithms using real-time environmental data from sources like NOAA, Copernicus, and HYCOM. The models integrate vessel-specific parameters (such as displacement, hull geometry, and engine specs) with ocean conditions to estimate fuel usage and CO₂ emissions.

This research is supported by:

- [BBVA Foundation](https://www.fbbva.es/) via the project "Mathematical optimization for a more efficient, safer and decarbonized maritime transport".

- Spanish [Agencia Estatal de Investigación](https://www.aei.gob.es/) under grant  TED2021-129455B-I00, "Optimization of maritime routes with real time oceanographic and meteorological data".
