We are excited to announce that Dr. Elena Fernández Aréizaga has published a chapter in the book "International Series in Operations Research & Management Science". The chapter, titled "Some Heuristic Methods for Discrete Facility Location with Uncertain Demands", delves into problems with inherent uncertainty. This research aligns well with our overall goal of optimizing shipping routes, as we work with weather predictions that have uncertainty.

Dr. Fernández has hold very relevant roles during her academic career, like the presidency of the Association of European Operational Research Societies and her professorship at the University of Cádiz. She recently joined our project on weather routing, backed by the support of the BBVA Foundation.

We want to express our heartfelt congratulations to Dr. Fernández!

Stay tuned for more updates on mathematical optimization and weather routing.
