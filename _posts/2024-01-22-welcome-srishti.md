As the new year begins, our research group remains committed to advancing maritime route optimization. We welcome Srishti Gupta, who has recently joined our team. She will bring a fresh perspective from her studies in applied mathematics at the Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee, one of India's premier universities known for its rigorous academic standards. Srishti arrived at Madrid on January 15th and will be collaborating with us at the IE Tower for the next three months.

The research of Srishti will concentrate on two key areas: the enhancement of land avoidance strategies and the development of innovative optimization algorithms. These areas are essential for improving the efficiency and safety of maritime routes. She will be collaborating with Daniel Precioso, a post-doctoral researcher at IE University, and Javier Jiménez, a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Cádiz. The research is supervised by Professor David Gómez-Ullate from IE University and includes contributions from Professor Rafael Ballester-Ripoll, whose expertise in mathematical algorithms is invaluable.

By the end of her internship with us, work will be part of her capstone project. It is expected to contribute significantly to an upcoming academic publication.

This weather routing research is supported by the BBVA Foundation and IE University. We acknowledge and appreciate their support in this collaborative effort.
