Daniel Precioso, representing Canonical Green, recently presented at the European Parliament, introducing an innovative solution called Green Navigation. The aim is to transform the shipping industry's sustainability efforts and reduce its carbon footprint significantly.

During the presentation, Daniel highlighted the concerning fact that the shipping industry releases a massive 30 tons of CO2 into the atmosphere every second, emphasizing the urgent need for impactful solutions.

Green Navigation, a data-driven approach developed by Canonical Green, offers shipping companies the means to cut their emissions by at least 2% while enhancing safety. Accessible and affordable, the solution only requires a computer and Internet access.

As a co-founder, Daniel called for funding to accelerate Green Navigation's development and improve its reliability. Collaboration with the wider shipping industry is crucial for creating a sustainable future together.

The presentation was made possible with the invaluable support of the BBVA Foundation, which has been instrumental in advancing research and initiatives like Green Navigation.
