Daniel Precioso, member of our research group, recently presented at the European Parliament, introducing our innovative weather routing solution. Our goal is to help the shipping industry by reducing its carbon footprint, thus reaching the Sustainable Development Goals faster!

During the presentation, Daniel highlighted a concerning fact: the shipping industry releases 30 tons of CO2 into the atmosphere every second. He emphasized the urgent need for impactful solutions. Weather routing offers shipping companies the means to cut their emissions by at least 2%, while being accesible and affordable (as it is run on the cloud). Daniel highlighted the need for collaboration between research and industry.

This accomplishment was made possible with the support of the BBVA Foundation. For those interested, Daniel's presentation at the European Parliament can be watched here: [https://youtu.be/T2VRDSczxVM](https://youtu.be/T2VRDSczxVM)

Together, through initiatives like our weather routing project, the shipping industry can lead the way towards a more sustainable future. Stay tuned for more updates on our research!
