Daniel Precioso, member of our research group, recently presented at the European Parliament, introducing our innovative weather routing solution. The aim is to transform the shipping industry's sustainability efforts and reduce its carbon footprint.

During the presentation, Daniel highlighted the concerning fact that the shipping industry releases 30 tons of CO2 into the atmosphere every second, emphasizing the urgent need for impactful solutions. Weather routing offers shipping companies the means to cut their emissions by at least 2% while enhancing safety. Accessible and affordable, the solution only requires a computer and Internet access. Daniel emphasized that collaboration with the shipping industry is crucial for creating a sustainable future together.

The presentation was made possible with the invaluable support of the BBVA Foundation, which has been instrumental in advancing research and initiatives like this research on weather routing.
