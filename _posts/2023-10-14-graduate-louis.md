It is a proud moment for the Weather Routing Research team, supported by the [BBVA Foundation](https://www.fbbva.es/) and [Agencia Estatal de Investigaci√≥n](https://www.aei.gob.es/). We are thrilled to announce that our team member, Louis Bu, a talented mathematician from Dalhousie University, has received the distinguished "Graduate Research Award" at the [2023 Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Science Conference (MSCS)](https://scienceatlantic.ca/news/ms-2023-award-winners/).

The MSCS is a key annual event in Atlantic Canada, uniting leading researchers in mathematics, statistics, and computer science. This conference focuses on fostering collaboration and sharing the latest advancements in these fields. MSCS 2023 was hosted at the University of Prince Edward Island, where Louis presented his research, "A Comparative Study on Optimization Methods for Maritime Transport Routing". His work is the culmination of more than a year worth of research in applying mathematics to weather routing. Louis showcased the different algorithms we have been developing to optimize maritime routes: our A-star graph search, our CMA evolutionary search, and our self-named "Hybrid Search" - [you can read about it here!](https://weathernavigation.com/news/2023/hybrid-search)

Louis' enthusiasm and dedication to his research are evident in his continued commitment to our team. We are excited to share that Louis will be continuing his research with us and is expected to visit Spain next year, extending our collaboration between IE University and Dalhousie University.

Congratulations on this well-deserved recognition, Louis! Keep your great work up!
