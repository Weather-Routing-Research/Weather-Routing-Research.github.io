### Abstract

We introduce the **Hybrid Search (HS) algorithm**, an innovative approach to tackle Zermelo's Navigation Problem. An extension of the Ferraro-Martín de Diego-Almagro method, this algorithm facilitates exploration for the global optimum, especially in scenarios with complex vector fields abundant with locally optimal trajectories.

Key features include:

- Applicability in both **Euclidean and spherical spaces**.
- Utilization of a heuristic that encourages forward vessel movement within a predetermined search cone focused on the destination.
- Enhanced **efficiency** and **obstacle avoidance** capabilities, making it ideal for real-world scenarios.

Performance assessments on synthetic vector fields and actual ocean currents have been carried out, affirming the algorithm's effectiveness and superior performance.
