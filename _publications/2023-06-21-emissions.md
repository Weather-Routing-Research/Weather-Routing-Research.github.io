### Abstract

The cruise shipping industry is committed to environmentally sustainable operation with many initiatives aiming to reduce greenhouse gas emissions... [truncate for brevity]

Key findings include:

- A total of 292 cruise routes were identified.
- Emissions from cruise activities were found to be roughly 0.58% of NOx, 0.28% of SO2, and 1% of CO2 of maritime transport emissions at the European level in 2019.
- Projected scenarios suggest a 77% reduction in SO2 emissions with SECA enforcement by 2025.
